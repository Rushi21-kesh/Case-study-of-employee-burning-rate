- ## Problem Statement:
  Mental health is the way we think and feel and our ability to deal with ups and downs. Your mental health doesn’t always stay the same. It can fluctuate as circumstances change and as you move through different stages in your life.
  
  According to an anonymous survey, about 450 million people live with mental disorders that can be one of the primary causes of poor health and disability worldwide. These days when the world is suffering from a pandemic situation, it becomes really hard to maintain mental fitness.
  
  In this project the data we collected talks about the employee Mental Fatigue Score and Burn Rate.
  
  - Mental Fatigue Score: The level of exhaustion mentally the employee is facing.
  - Burn Rate: The overall rate of the employee stress level.

- ## Project Overview:
  The main goal of this project is to understand and analyze the mental health data of employee. This can be acheived using the employee ‘Mental Fatigue Score’, ‘Working Hours’, ‘Burn Rate’, ‘Company Type’ etc.

- ## Objectives:		
  In this we are going to analyze the data of employee using pyspark and spark-sql commands.

- ## Conclusion:
  	Good mental health at work and good management go hand in hand and there is strong evidence that workplaces with high levels of mental wellbeing are more productive. Addressing wellbeing at work increases productivity by as much as 12%. 

- ## In order to acheive this :
    - Do regular exercise that boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and look and feel better. 
    - Try and make sure you maintain your friendships and family relationships even when work is intense – a work–life balance is important, and experts now believe that loneliness may be as bad for our health as smoking or obesity.
    - Try and plan periods of leave for the year so that you always have a break to look forward to.
    - Try talking to your colleagues about your problems and also listen to them when they are in need.
    - Eat well and Sleep well.
